I included both text files of the lats and longs, I thought it would be more difficult to clean with regex but it was not

^ 
regex text cleaning ^ space - remove the leading whitespace at the beginning of the first 391 lines

^Pin_.{33}
remove the redundant pin at the beginning of each line

Remove redundant columns, I thought this would be more challenging
DisplayNumber:0, TableID:'13', DisplayID:'2523'. Bucket:0, Sent:'S', Show: 1, Checked:false

Status:'1851'

did not leave a space between ,Info did a regex replace, ,Info with , Info

replaced all commas with nothing to get rid of the commas in sales price

replaced spaces with commas

added back an end of line comma for syntax to get my list of key value pairs

removed the dollar sign from currency, don't think i need this for these purposes

if you're still reading this far maybe you'd enjoy a song lyric that's not at all a rip off of a rip off ;)

I call it....seasons of code

525,600 features

525,000 beta coefficients

525,000 boosting algorithms

How can I build you 1 decision tree?

There’s lasso, and gradient, and the worst ever neural network

There’s Booleans, and bitwise, and eigen vectors

what are their values?!?!?

There’s a dude that doesn’t go here 

doesn’t even know lambda functions

There’s help if, you ask enough

But only for KNN

And what about scorrreees

Scorrreeees

Just made up math.


................................................or maybe this other one i hacked together?

I've been staring at the monitor

long as a nueron can remember

no matter how hard i type

all the strings I write.....

i wish i could be the perfect coder

i come back to the monitor....

every loop i write 

all the code I hack

every path/to/file incorrect

all the code leads back

to the loops i know

that will run so slow....


.........................that has to be all of the hacky disney and musical rip offs right?

well...

do you wanna build a model?

come on lets go and code!

i never write while loops anymore 

my models are so poor 

it's like I found a minima!

do you wanna build a model?

a machine learning model?

I think some cross val is overdue 

i've started talking to the function callssss!

it gets a little lonely

all these empty cells 

just watching the epochs tick by

data are you in there?

people are asking what you mean (shoulder shrug emoji, bewildered i dunno emoji)

people say code harder and I'm trying skew, just set up git pull

we only have two branches....just me and you... what are we going to code?
